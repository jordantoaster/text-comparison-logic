Requirements
-------------

- Detect 'changes' - type and granularity are extensions of this.
- Return results in a way that can be painted onto the original PDF


Match-Patch-Diff
-----------------
- We cant control the internal workings of the algorithm
- Its mandating complexity due to 'odd' behaviours (length of input etc) -> sliding window


Plan
-----

- For a given pair of input strings, can each in character sequence ('view' size of 1).
- Detect a change / mismatch - continue until the text is matching again via a word match (character can clash early).
- Return data structure which contains text that is changed, and what string it belonged to.


TODO
----
- change 'view' to differing sizes
- write unit tests on approach
- Increase input complexity and size from the simplest possible position (all text matches - one char change ... etc)
- Is there existing other logic and approaches we can leverage? Google! text difference comparison - libraries already?
- Text similarity could also be useful as a means to match up once again.
- When a change occurs, can we just show both text until we match again?
- diff worker does not work when before is longer than B and B contains an addition (so cant be found in A)
